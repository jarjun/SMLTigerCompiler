How to run: 
To run either compile the group with 'sml sources.cm' then in the sml terminal run 'Main.compile "$filename"' inserting the test file into $filename
or use the makefile and run 'make compile file=$filename' where $filename is the test file (without quotes in this case).
There is currently no result output. The allocation results are apparent in the generated .s MIPS file.
